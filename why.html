            <li>Personal Entertainment Package</li>
            <p>You throw out jokes that could make a rock cringe, but your awful roasts have somehow become a hilarious survival game for me. Oddly enough, I find myself chuckling at all your silly jokes, by turning myself as the meme subject most of the times.</p>
            <li>Cure for Hypersomnia</li>
            <p>Who needs a solid eight hours of sleep when you can have a relationship with me. You don't have to waste your time napping because I'm always around to snack on your brain cells. Plus, you can dodge those bad dreams by just skipping sleep altogether.</p>
            <li>Emotional and Physical Fitness Guru</li>
            <p>Love is the ultimate workout for the heart, both metaphorically and literally. I'm your free-of-charge fitness guru, keeping you in top shape, both body and mind. Think of me as your personal coach. I've got your health covered without any hidden fees.</p>
            <li>Ultimate Cat Whisperer</li>
            <p>I knock so much sense into your head. I serve up a gossip buffet, not just about me, but also spill the tea on what the other 69 dimbos are up to. My news delivery is speedier than TV9, all to keep you so well-informed that you never risk looking clueless in front of others.</p>
